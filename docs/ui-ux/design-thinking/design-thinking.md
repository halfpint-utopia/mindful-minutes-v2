## 5Ws

The table can serve as a foundation for brainstorming and designing potential solutions using the Design Thinking approach, and provides a starting point for identifying:

- **Who**
  - the key stakeholders
- **What**
  - the problem and its manifestations
- **When**
  - the time-frame
- **Where**
  - the contexts in which the problems occurs
- **Why**
  - motivations behind addressing the problem

![Design Thinking: 5Ws](../../media/images/design-thinking_5ws.png)

In summary individuals struggle with procrastination, finding it challenging to start or complete tasks within the desired time-frame. This behaviour can occur in various aspects of their lives, including personal responsibilities and professional obligations. They may face difficulties in planning their tasks effectively, leading to a lack of structure and organisation in their work. Individuals may also experience a decline in motivation, finding it hard to maintain enthusiasm and drive to accomplish their goals.

The issues surrounding procrastination include poor task planning and low motivation which can affect individuals from their early year into adulthood. It can manifest in academic pursuits, career goals, personal projects and simple day-to-day tasks.

By addressing the problem, individuals aim to overcome their tendencies to procrastinate, develop robust planning strategies and enhance their overall motivation. They aspire to gain a better understanding of their underlying psychological factors contributing to procrastination and find effective methods to manage their time and task efficiently. Ultimately, the objective is to achieve a higher level of productivity with an emphasis on **introspection**, being able identify satisfaction in both personal and professional endeavours

## Problem Statement

![Design Thinking: Problem Statement](../../media/images/design-thinking_problem-statement.png)

The problem statement for individuals struggling with procrastination, difficulty in planning and achieving tasks, as well as, losing motivation can be formulated as follows:

> Individuals face challenges in effectively managing their tasks, as they struggle with chronic procrastination, inadequate planning skills and diminishing motivation. This issue persists throughout their lives, impacting personal and professional contexts, hindering their ability to meet deadlines, achieve goals and maintain a sense of motivation. As a result, there is a pressing need to understand the root causes of procrastination, develop practical planning strategies and reignite individuals' motivation to enable them to over these obstacles and enhance their overall productivity and fulfilment.

### The (Drafted) Concepts

Drafts were created in [Figma](https://figma.com). Please see the [drafts for Concept A & B in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0dqJufUdcM2ZNwxmbKpLzZ/Design-Feedback-(Concept-A-%26-B)?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=7BN0IWFqODDsJggl-1).

### Reflection & Iteration Ideas

  ![Results from design feedback questionnaire](../../media/images/design-thinking_design-feedback-questionnaire-results.png)

  Overall, the participant had a positive reaction to the concept of the app, appreciating the timer feature and the ability to mark tasks as completed. They provided valuable feed on including a "do not disturb" button, adding a pending tasks section and incorporating a timer for tasks that require focus. These suggestions can be considered for improving the concept and enhancing the user experience of the app. 

  Note:

  This feedback report is based on the input and feedback provided by a single participant. As there is only one participant, it was important to consider gathering feedback from a larger and diverse group of participants to obtain a more comprehensive and representative understanding fo user perspective and preferences.

Due to requiring further data, I asked to present the questionnaire in one of the weekly cohort stand-up meetings, where the following were present:
- Rebecca Tracey-Timoney
- Tomislav Dukez
- Hope Tracy Njoroge

![Design Thinking: Iteration Ideas](../../media/images/design-thinking_iteration-ideas.png)

Based on the feedback received during the stand-up meeting, I (the design team) should consider integrating the best elements from both concepts to create a well-rounded solution. The participants' positive reception of the mobile-first design, emphasis on CRUD functionality and suggestions for additional features provide valuable insights for further refining the design and improving user experience.
